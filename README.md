### ⚙️ How to Run
1. Open any `.cpp` file in your preferred IDE (VS Code / Dev C++ / Code::Blocks).  
2. Compile and run using:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ./output

🎯 Learning Outcome

By exploring this repository, you will:

1. Develop a strong understanding of how data structures work internally.
2. Learn efficient algorithm design techniques and complexity analysis.
3. Gain problem-solving skills for competitive programming and interviews.
4. Write clean, optimized, and reusable C++ code.
5. Strengthen your logical thinking and algorithmic approach.

🧠 Recommended Practice

1. Try modifying each program with your own examples.
2. Analyze time and space complexity for every algorithm.
3. Use these codes to prepare for coding interviews and online contests.
